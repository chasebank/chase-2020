### About The AAU
The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was founded in 1888 and pioneered standards and uniformity in amateur sports.

With nearly 700,000 members and 150,000 volunteers, they support sports organizations throughout the United States, starting at a local grass roots level.

### What I worked on
Visual styles associated with common sports brands (Nike, Gatorade, ESPN) have a dramatic, extreme aesthetic. This fits the competitive nature of sports, pushing through boundaries to achieve greatness.

AAU is an "amateur" league, but I wanted to create designs that share that recognizable “big league” style.

I started with working to modernize the main AAU brand, representing the central organization.

I also created "hero images" to represent each of the many different sports. Those images were originally designed as large posters, but were then adapted as a sort of theme to apply in other formats, such as fliers, tri-fold brochures and booklets. Each matching a consistent design for that individual sport.

### Some more details

#### Meeting all the needs
AAU is a central organization, but individual teams and leagues span the entire United States. They each have a wide variety of marketing needs ranging from events and tournaments, fundraising, recruitment, and community building.

My task was to design items that could uniformly adapt to all use cases. Rather than constrain usefulness with generic “one size fits all” designs/verbiage, we created items with text that could be fully customized, through an online ordering platform, meeting each unique need.

This included designs with simple headings and personal contact info, like business cards, stationary, or large text on posters. We also offered items with entire bodies of custom text, like brochures, flyers, and booklets.

#### The perfect photo
Most of these designs feature people playing sports. Ideally, a project may budget for custom photography, which not only lends useful design assets, but also opens opportunities for a more personal touch, featuring *actual* AAU members. Maybe name them brand ambassadors and publish their stories...

Unfortunately this wasn't an option, which required sourcing stock photos. This presents new concerns of proper licensing and costs, but finding quality sports-themed photos of amateur athletes proved surprisingly most challenging.

For design elements without people, like textures and backgrounds, sourcing photos is easier. The stylized AAU shield logo, for instance, has texture within the blue and red parts, taken from the reflective patterns in a car tail light. And the blue background of the basketball poster is mostly [royalty-free NASA photos](https://images.nasa.gov/), taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. [Public domain photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Public_domain_image_resources), like many published by governments, can offer great solutions. Staying aware of these resources has always been useful.
