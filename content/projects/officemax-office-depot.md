### About OfficeMax
OfficeMax is an office supply retailer, offering solutions for all facets of business; such as technology, furniture, support and management, and print.

OfficeMax also offered unique commercial solutions to large corporate clients, which is where I worked.

In 2014 OfficeMax “merged with”/was acquired competitor Office Depot.

### What I worked on
I was a Graphic Designer in a commercial print center. Clients included local entrepreneurs and small businesses, but mostly centered on larger corporate clients throughout the region, such as Walt Disney World, Tupperware, Hilton Hotels, universities and healthcare companies, etc.

Though my primary role was design, working closely with production gave me valuable experience and useful insight. I learned where shortcuts and pitfalls were and how to use and avoid them. This helped me take on sales and consultation roles, sometimes on-site, working with prospective clients, and supporting existing ones.

I also worked with internal clients, designing for the OfficeMax Sales and retail Merchandising teams.

During the OfficeMax/Office Depot merger, I designed marketing to help communicate a seamless unification of both brands.

### Some examples

#### Merchandising Display
I was part of a small team tasked with creating in-store marketing displays to showcase seasonal print products.

The main goal was to design something that could be re-produced entirely "in-house", by staff in every store, using only materials and capabilities already available.

If successful, we could reduce high manufacturing and distribution costs usually associated with similar displays.

##### Requirements
 * Feature actual physical sample products for customers to touch & feel, to gauge quality & value. Some of these products were produced by outside vendors, which was the only element needing distribution to the stores.
 * All other elements of the display had to be created by each store’s own print & copy department, and assembled by store staff.
 * All materials/tools used in the assembly process needed to be already available in every store.
 * Comprehensive assembly instructions also had to be created and distributed, along with high-resolution print files.

To insure each store was capable of the assembly requirements, we had to establish a baseline of minimum capability of ***all*** stores, and work our way out from there. A “minimum viable product” of sorts.

If our instructions required .5” 3M doublesided tape, or a particular sized support shelf, or a panel to be printed on large format 36” 80# “premium gloss” and mounted to quarter inch foamcore and laminated… we had to be certain every store had these items and capabilities.

We also strived for labor efficient creation and assembly. We couldn't condemn staff to hours of unproductive frustration. (ala IKEA furniture)

Considering all those factors, I started by designing some digital prototypes.

In-store teams worked on testing the assembly process, which was itself a prototype, since the assembly instructions were part of our deliverables.

Pain points and limitations were identified and iterated on, until we settled on something that looked professional, on-brand, and fairly straight forward to build.

It was largely a success, and was repeated multiple times for different seasonal themes, using the same processes of in-house creation and assembly.
