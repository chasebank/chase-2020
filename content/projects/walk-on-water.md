### About Walk on Water

Walk on Water is a retail fashion company in Orlando Florida.

Through their local boutiques, they sell clothing, jewelry, gifts, & accessories. Most profits are returned to the community through charitable outreach, including many fundraising events, like fashion shows and an annual 5k.

### What I worked on

When I started working with Walk on Water, I inherited years of existing designs, with the fingerprints of many past designers. There wasn’t a clear look or feel for the brand.

There was also what I call “design debt”, where design files have been continually edited and repurposed over time for multiple projects. Eventually they grow into convoluted monoliths that are challenging to work with at a technical level. It can be a difficult productivity judgment on when to recycle & edit, vs. starting fresh.

As I designed new marketing items, I worked on creating a more consistent and recognizable style that could be referenced in all future designs. And I worked toward ensuring new design files were purposefully structured in a way that kept long-term reuse in mind, such as carefully organizing layers and labels, working at higher resolutions and adding excess bleed margins to lend some wiggle room for re-sizing.

The projects spanned from common standards like brochures, posters and postcards... to magazine ads, in-store signage and merchandising displays, social media, and business-to-business collateral.

### Some detailed examples

#### Snapchat Geo-filter

Having admittedly ZERO experience with Snapchat... I was asked to create a “Geo-Filter" for a charity 5k event.

SnapChat lets users apply fun ”filters” to photos, with various graphic overlays. I knew that much, at least, but it turns out there's a cool premium feature catered toward events. You create a “geo-fence” which is basically a custom drawn outline of an area on a map (wherever your event will be held). Then, you can have SnapChat offer a custom sponsored filter to anyone within that area, at a particular date and time.

Guests take photos, apply the filter and share them on social media, creating fun memories and brand publicity.

Once I understood how the system worked, I had to review the specifications and file requirements to make sure the filter worked on all devices and screen sizes. It was a fun and unique project.

#### Foil accent business cards

I wanted cards that stood out but were cheap to produce. I used unique foil accents on some past projects, a form of “cold foil” that allows full-color printing overtop of foil, to add metallic accents to any image. There was only one printer I knew of that could do it reliably, but it was surprisingly cheap considering how cool the result is.

A masking image is provided to indicate where the foil should be applied (white areas get foil and black areas do not), as well as the full color design to be printed over top. I used gold foil to be printed under red ink, which made for a nice bright fiery red color.

We created personalized business cards for all members of management, as well as a generic card with space for sales associates to write in their name as they assist customers. Matte paper stock was used to make sure pen ink didn’t smear.
